# QuintaOS Kernel Law v0.1 — Genesis State

**Status:** Frozen. Immutable. Normative.  
This document is the constitutional foundation of QuintaOS.

---

## Purpose

This law defines the minimal conditions under which an action **may exist** within QuintaOS.

It defines **permission only**.  
It does not define continuity, provenance, causality, containment, or recovery.

Later laws may refine authority, but may not weaken or override this law.

---

## Core Principles

- All authority derives from explicit capabilities.
- No ambient or implicit authority exists.
- Entities are the sole loci of authority.
- The kernel is the sole evaluator of existence.
- Denied actions do not exist.

---

## Permission Rule

An action may exist **if and only if** all of the following hold:

1. A capability is presented.
2. The capability grants the requested right.
3. The subject of the capability matches the acting entity.
4. The object of the capability matches the target entity.
5. No authority is inferred or assumed.

If any condition fails:

**The action does not exist.**

---

## Silence Is Denial

If any required information is missing, unknown, or unevaluable:

**The action is denied.**

---

## Non-Goals

This law explicitly does not define:
- Processes
- Users
- Files
- Devices
- Scheduling
- Resource management

---

## Closing Statement

This law defines the **Genesis authority semantics** of QuintaOS.

All later laws are strictly additive.  
This law is never amended, only relied upon.

**Authority begins here.**
