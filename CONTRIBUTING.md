# Contributing to QuintaOS

Thank you for your interest in QuintaOS.

This project follows **strict governance rules**.

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Existing Kernel Laws are **immutable**.
- Law evolution is **additive only**.
- Authority must never be widened by later changes.
- No ambient authority may be introduced.
- Silence must always be treated as denial.

Submissions that violate these rules will not be accepted.

---

## Acceptable Contributions

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- Formal verification and proof work
- Law clarification (without semantic change)
- Kernel primitives compliant with existing laws
- Testing, adversarial modeling, and review
- Documentation improvements

---

## What Not to Submit

Please do not submit:
- POSIX abstractions
- Implicit privilege mechanisms
- Shortcuts that bypass law evaluation
- “Temporary” hacks that weaken guarantees

---

## Process

- Open an issue before large changes
- Explain how invariants are preserved or strengthened
- Expect rigorous review — this is intentional

QuintaOS prioritizes **correctness over convenience**.
